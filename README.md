### Overview
Filter exchange imaging (FEXI) with thin imaging slices requires strong crushers, which bias exchange rate estimates and confound exchange with restricted diffusion. The proposed modified tuned exchange imaging (TEXI) protocol provides accurate exchange rates regardless of slice thickness and restriction size, even with strong crushers.

This repository contains FEXI and TEXI pulse sequence parameters, results from Monte Carlo simulations and Matlab code used in the publication [Lasi훾 et al., NMR Biomed. 2024;e5208. doi:10.1002/nbm.5208](http://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.5208).

Matlab scripts:

- `TEXI_make_seq.m`\
Make parameters for FEXI and TEXI sequences. TEXI waveforms have constant $bV_\omega$. Only the sequence parameters and info to generate effective gradient waveforms are saved in the "sequence" folder as `VT_*.mat` (for $V_\omega$ tuned TEXI) and `FEXI_*.mat` (for the original FEXI). The waveforms can be generated with `def_FEXI.m` and `def_sequence.m`.\
This script can save ADCs from frequency-domain GPA calculations and tune sequences based on the entire restricted diffusion spectrum for a given geometry and restriction size (not used in the manuscript). For a more general tuning, the sequence parameters and the corresponding ADC values are saved for a wide range of encodings with constant b-values (`b_*.mat` and `*_DvsR.mat` files). The tuned sequence parameters are then selected based on equal ADC values and the "size"-tuned sequence is saved as `ST_*.mat` file.

- `TEXI_make_data_and_seq_reduce_b_VT.m`\
Make new data and sequence files with a reduced set of b values for the VT sequence and save them as `*_reduceBrange.mat` files.
